# Handwritten_Digit_Recognition_with_Multi_Layer_Perceptron

Created a handwritten digit recognition model using an MLP with 2 hidden layers on the MNIST dataset (70,000 images). • Enhanced model training procedures by implementing rigorous testing over 50 epochs, resulting in an accuracy of 98.5% and a 15% reduction in overall error rate, positively impacting customer satisfaction metrics. • Enhanced digit classification accuracy through dropout and batch normalization techniques.
